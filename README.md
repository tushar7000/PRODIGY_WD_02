# Description for 

This is a simple **Stopwatch Web Application** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The application allows users to start, stop, reset, and record lap times. The stopwatch tracks hours, minutes, and seconds, with an option to record lap times during the stopwatch run. It is responsive and user-friendly with basic interaction features.

# Features:
- **Start/Stop**: Start or stop the stopwatch with the same button.
- **Lap Functionality**: Record lap times and display them below the main stopwatch.
- **Reset**: Reset the stopwatch to 00:00:00 and clear all recorded lap times.
- **Interactive Buttons**: Buttons change dynamically based on the stopwatch state (Start/Stop, Lap, Reset).
- **Formatted Time Display**: Time is displayed in the format HH:MM:SS with zero-padding for single digits.

# Technologies Used:
- **HTML**: Structure of the stopwatch app.
- **CSS**: Styling for the buttons, display, and overall layout.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for the stopwatch functionality (start/stop, reset, lap) and dynamic updates.

# How it Works:
1. **Start**: Clicking the "Start" button starts the stopwatch and changes the button text to "Stop".
2. **Stop**: Clicking the "Stop" button stops the stopwatch and changes the button text back to "Start".
3. **Lap**: Clicking the "Lap" button records the current time and adds it to the lap list.
4. **Reset**: Clicking the "Reset" button resets the stopwatch to 00:00:00 and clears the lap times.

This simple app can be easily integrated into any personal or project website that requires time tracking features.
